The goal of this project was to recreate an example portfolio using CSS as well as the bootstrap CSS framework. Three webpages were created, an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page and a "Contact" page. The page design was made using bootstrap with some custom CSS coding as well for more specific spacing and coloring. 

The only prerequisites to run this project are the files present in the reposition. Deployment has been done through github pages at:
